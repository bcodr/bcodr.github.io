Having the chance to meet some incredible women from all over the world represented by so many different backgrounds, languages, ideologies, philosophies, ethnicities and cultures was an enriching experience I will treasure for the rest of my life. To have the honor to represent Ecuador, its culture, traditions and idiosyncrasy has been one of the greatest privileges of my existence. On my journey to the crown I first had to learn about failures and about new opportunities and in order to succeed I had to learn to be strong, and to believe in myself through wisdom and maturity that I have tried and will always try to obtain with each passing day.<\/p>\n<p>Miss Global is a pageant that truly empowers women and in order to achieve empowerment one must learn to truly love oneself, to embrace oneself by believing in our capacities, and specially, one must come to terms with the fact that all the good and bad experiences have shaped us into who we are and we<\/p>\n<p>should always be able to look at ourselves and know with a great deal of conviction that it is possible to achieve our dreams and goals, no matter what those are. Confidence comes with the responsibility of accepting and loving who we are and what we are and not allowing anything or anyone to take that away from us.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the glamour, the spotlights and the attention I have received, this title means hard work and responsibility. If there is one message I would like to convey during my reign is to never give up, to never allow anyone dictate what one can and cannot do because we are all capable to achieve what our heart desires. I plan to be a role model and through my own personal experiences try to inspire others to never let people make decisions for us.<\/p>\n<p>More than a beauty queen I would love to be viewed as a human being who can bring a word of wisdom and inspiration especially for young girls who feel left out, discriminated or those who think that their circumstances will prevent them from achieving greatness. I would like to leave a legacy that speaks for itself through my work as Miss Global.<\/p>\n<p>I am very grateful to the people in the Philippines for giving me so much love before, during and after the pageant. To the Miss Global organization for allowing me to make my dream come true and to all Ecuadorians all over the world who have supported me and encouraged me throughout this journey. Thank you for allowing me to represent our country internationally and I look forward to an incredible year as Miss global 2016.<\/p>\n<p>\t<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/DvlmTDNGNBM?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen class=\"no-lazyload\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Miss Global 2016 Angela Bonilla &#8211; Ecuador About Angela On Sept 24th, 2016 history was made as I became the first woman from Latin America to win the coveted title of Miss Global.
