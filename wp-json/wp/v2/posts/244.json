She will sit as one of the judges at the coronation night on June 24. Angela is so excited for the task ahead as first-time judge.<\/p>\n<p>She also shared with Showbuzz that her visit to the Philippines is something really looked forward to, and truly an unforgettable experience<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI love the Philippines. It\u2019s my second home. Like in Ecuador, my home country, people here are very warm, very friendly. I have actually made a lot of friends the first time I came here last year for the Miss Global international pageant.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Besides judging the pageant, Angela is also helping the Miss Global Philippines Organization in its advocacy of promoting tourism.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI really want to tell the world how beautiful the Philippines is and I can attest to that. Last year, when we went to Bohol as part of our activities in Miss Global, I almost cried when I saw the island. It\u2019s so beautiful. It\u2019s something we don\u2019t have back home. I want the people of the world to know that the Philippines is very beautiful and the people here are very nice.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Angela is excited to visit Boracay and Palawan next week, her first in both popular Philippine tourist spots.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of good things about Boracay and Palawan and I believe they are all true. I have seen these places in pictures but I know they will be more beautiful in person,\u201d she enthused.<\/p>\n<p>It did Angela a lot of good winning Miss Global 2016.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt helped me in my professional work as a model and actress. I did a lot of commercials, and I got offers for acting projects but I can\u2019t accept them yet because I still have to fulfill my duties as Miss Global. I will entertain the offers when I go back to Ecuador,\u201d she related.<\/p>\n<p>While in the Philippines, is she open to opportunities that may come?<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhy not?\u201d the beauty queen replied. \u201cIt would be an honor for me to do projects here. I am even willing to learn Tagalog if needed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In the meantime, Angela is scheduled to guest in some GMA shows like \u201cWowowin,\u201d \u201cSunday Pinasaya,\u201d \u201cEat Bulaga\u201d and \u201cUnang Hirit\u201d to promote the pageant.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.manilatimes.net\/solenn-heusaff-well-baby-next-year\/332892\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http:\/\/www.manilatimes.net\/solenn-heusaff-well-baby-next-year\/332892\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Reigning Miss Global Angela Bonilla of Ecuador is in the country for the Miss Global Philippines 2017 pageant.
