Pham in 2011. Prior to creating Miss Global Organization, Van M. Pham has been in the pageant industry since 2003 working primarily within the Vietnamese community to promote Vietnamese beauty pageants.\u00a0 In 2009, Van Pham had the opportunity to meet both Miss World 2008 and the President of Miss World, Julia Morley.\u00a0 This encounter\u00a0 allowed Van Pham to realize he can go beyond the Vietnamese community in creating a global platform that can not only unite diverse women from all walks of life but to create a platform that can truly make a positive impact in making\u00a0 a difference in the world. Miss Global is about empowering women, giving them a voice to speak up in making a difference. It&#8217;s about embracing cultures, accepting our differences, celebrating our diversity and understanding that is what makes us special and unique. Lastly, Miss Global is about embodying the beauty within all of us, accepting who we are and knowing that we all have the ability within us to make a difference in the world.\u00a0Miss Global is an extravagant and prestigious competition beyond just the physical beauty of women from all over the world. The contestants are encouraged to express their individuality with poise, grace, and wits. Being the Winner of Miss Global, a beauty and cultural pageant, is being a sponsor of goodwill, a trendsetter for leadership, and an ambassador for beauty and cultural diversity.<\/p>\t\t\n\t<p>The launching of the official Miss Global beauty pageant will set the new standards for a wider age range and a more diverse selection of qualified female participants between the ages of 18-35. Although the reign of Miss Global is a yearlong, this remarkable Queen will travel throughout the world to participate in charitable fundraisers while promoting the beauty, intelligence, and charm of women throughout the world. She will have a once in a life time opportunity to gain innumerable contacts, lifelong friendship, and endless support from diverse communities that will advance her status beyond imaginable outlooks.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>About Us Miss Global&#8217;s Slogan &#8220;Empowering women, Embracing cultures, and Embodying the beauty within&#8221; About the Miss Global Organization Miss Global Organization, LLC was founded by Van M.
